# Portfolio Content Strategy & Project Analysis

## Process Overview

**What we're doing:**
1. Analyzed your GitHub projects (TinyMacro, MyHRBuddy, FileBuddy, Drive Organizer)
2. Identifying what makes a strong PM portfolio
3. Recommending specific media types for each project
4. Creating guidance for improved copy based on project details
5. You'll gather the media assets
6. I'll write better-informed portfolio descriptions

## What Makes a Strong PM Portfolio

As someone transitioning from IC (individual contributor) work to PM roles, your portfolio should demonstrate:

### 1. **Problem-Solution Thinking**
- Clearly articulate the problem you identified
- Show how you scoped and validated the problem
- Explain your solution approach and why you chose it

### 2. **Strategic Artifacts**
- **Specs & PRDs**: Show your planning and requirements gathering
- **Competitive analysis**: Demonstrate market awareness
- **User research**: Show you understand your users
- **Presentation decks**: Prove you can communicate to stakeholders

### 3. **Execution Evidence**
- Screenshots showing actual working products
- Metrics/impact (you already have some of this - 20% CTR improvement, 100k API calls)
- Architecture diagrams showing technical depth
- Before/after comparisons

### 4. **Cross-Functional Leadership**
- Evidence of working with different teams
- Technical documentation you created for engineers
- Presentations given to leadership
- Process improvements you drove

- [ ] **Demo video** (2-3 min) - Full walkthrough of the organization flow
- [ ] **Metrics** - How many images organized? Time saved? Accuracy rate?

**Ideal Format:**
- Your existing screenshots (dashboard, drive browser, analysis, organization)
- Short demo video showing the entire flow
- Before/after comparison of a Drive folder

## Additional Portfolio Content Recommendations

### Presentation Decks
**Recommended for:**
- **Larta Institute AI pilot** (✅ RESTRUCTURED AS DECK-BASED PROJECT)
  - Show your specs, competitor analysis, feasibility research
  - This is now the main focus of the Context Engine project
- Wheel the World MarTech launch (show the 20% CTR improvement story)
- Any internal presentations about workflow automation

**What to include:**
- Problem statement slide
- Solution approach slide
- Competitor analysis/market landscape
- Technical architecture proposal
- Cost modeling & feasibility
- Key metrics/impact slide
- Next steps/roadmap slide

**For Context Engine specifically, include:**
- [ ] Product spec overview slide
- [ ] Competitor analysis (RAG vs Knowledge Graph solutions)
- [ ] Proposed architecture diagram
- [ ] Cost/feasibility analysis
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies
- [ ] Precision@k improvement methodology

### Specs & PRDs
**Best candidates:**
- Larta AI pilot comprehensive specs (you mentioned these in your CV)
- Any feature specs you wrote for Wheel the World
- TinyMacro runbook design (if documented)

**Format:**
- PDF with key sections highlighted
- Or: Screenshots of critical sections with annotations

### Locked/NDA Section

## Copy Writing Guidance

Once you gather media, I'll write improved copy that:

### For Each Project, Include:
1. **The Problem** (2-3 sentences)
   - What pain point did you identify?
   - Who experiences this problem?

2. **Your Solution** (3-4 sentences)
   - What did you build?
   - Key technical decisions and why
   - What makes your approach unique?

3. **Impact & Results** (2-3 bullet points)
   - Quantitative metrics where possible
   - Qualitative improvements
   - Adoption/usage stats

4. **Your Role** (1-2 sentences)
   - What parts did you own?
   - Any cross-functional work?

5. **Technical Details** (optional expandable section)
   - Tech stack
   - Architecture decisions
   - Interesting technical challenges

---

## Next Steps

1. **Gather screenshots/videos** for each project based on recommendations above
2. **Drop them in `media/projects/`** with clear naming:
   - `tinymacro-architecture.png`
   - `myhrbuddy-dashboard.png`
   - `filebuddy-demo.gif`
   - etc.

3. **Let me know what you have** and I'll write compelling copy for each project

4. **For presentation decks/specs**: Export key slides as images or PDFs, place in `media/projects/`

## Notes & Considerations

### For HubSpot Consulting Angle
You mentioned wanting to target HubSpot developer consulting work:
- Consider a separate portfolio item highlighting your HubSpot expertise
- Screenshots of CRM automation flows you built
- Before/after metrics from Wheel the World MarTech work
- Link to HubSpot developer profile if you have one

### GitHub Cleanup
You mentioned wanting to clean up GitHub repos:
- Add proper READMEs (some already exist!)
- Add architecture diagrams to repos
- Consider adding a `docs/` folder with:
  - Architecture overview
  - Getting started guide
  - Example use cases
  - Demo screenshots

### Public vs Private Repos
For TinyMacro (you mentioned keeping private dev, public showcase):
- Create a public `tinymacro-showcase` repo
- Include: README, architecture docs, key examples
- Add note: "Active development happens in private repo"
- Link from portfolio with explanation of approach

## Questions for You

1. Do you have any existing presentation decks from Larta or Wheel the World?
2. Are there any metrics/analytics screenshots you can grab from your projects?
3. Which project do you want to prioritize for gathering media first?
4. Any NDAs or confidentiality concerns I should know about for specific projects?
