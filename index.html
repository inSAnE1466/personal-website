        <section class="about">
            <p>I'm interested in building things that matter: AI products, sustainability tech, and systems that create real impact. Most recently, I worked at <a href="https://www.larta.org" target="_blank">Larta Institute</a> developing enterprise AI pilots that interact with federal research programs, navigating complex data architectures within NOAA and USDA. Before that, I was at <a href="https://wheeltheworld.com/" target="_blank">Wheel the World</a>, an accessible travel startup, where I built AI-powered marketing tools that doubled response rates and an image search system that hit 100k+ API calls in its first month.</p>

            <p>I have experience with full stack development, utilizing JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and SQL. Most of my recent focus has been on AI/ML implementations using RAG, knowledge graphs, and semantic chunking to build end to end solutions for an array of different busines cases. I have also built CRM automation tools, particularly in HubSpot, and spend time on the product side doing feasibility analyses, cost modeling, and technical documentation. The technical work matters, but I think the more important skill is knowing what to build and why. With all the AI hype right now, taste is becoming the differentiator.</p>

            <p>I'm finishing my economics degree at UCLA (graduating December 2026) with a minor in Environmental Systems and Society. I am fascinated with greentech and energy startups, really any tech that pushes things forward in a meaningful direction. In 2023, I led the Oakland branch of Tree-Plenish and powered a motivated team of peers to planted 100+ fruit trees, offsetting over half of my high school's yearly carbon emissions. That project earned me the David Brower Conservation Award, but more importantly it taught me how to turn limited resources into real impact.</p>

            <p>I believe systems should improve the world, not just operate within it. That's what draws me to building things rather than just optimizing them.
