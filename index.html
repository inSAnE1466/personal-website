        <section class="about">
            <p>I aspire to build solutions on the cornerstone of state-of-the-art technological innovation and complex global issues. I have been fortunate to fill my early career with top-of-industry greentech, climate solutions, and compelling AI products that make meaningful impact. I believe good systems should improve the world, not just operate within it.</p>

            <p>Over the past two and a half years, I've worked on AI infrastructure and product development. At <a href="https://www.larta.org" target="_blank">Larta Institute</a>, I built an enterprise AI pilot for federal research programs, navigating complex data architectures and building product specifications for NOAA and USDA. Before that, at <a href="https://wheeltheworld.com/" target="_blank">Wheel the World</a>, an accessible travel startup, I built AI-powered marketing automation tools and enterprise-scale data infrastructure for content management and discovery. I have professional experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and SQL, focusing on AI/ML implementations using RAG, knowledge graphs, and semantic chunking. I've also built CRM automations with HubSpot Developer tools and spend time on the product side doing feasibility analyses, cost modeling, and technical documentation.</p>

            <p>I'm finishing my economics degree at UCLA (graduating December 2026) with a minor in Environmental Systems and Society. Through my coursework, I've developed skills in econometric modeling, regression analysis, and data analytics using R and Python. My economics background has given me a framework for thinking about systems, incentives, and how to measure impact.</p>

            <p>If building thoughtful, impactful technology is interesting to you, don't hesitate to reach out. You can get a full picture of my work through my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> or <a href="PWmedia/Frederick_Casey-Housand resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.</p>
